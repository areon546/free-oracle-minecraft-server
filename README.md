### Setting up the Minecraft Server
If it is a modded server, make sure to install whatever version of Forge or Fabric of whatnot that is used as the backbone of the server. 

#### Installing links via the internet
To install a link via the internet, you need to type in the following command into the terminal. 

```unix
wget [linkToObject]
```

You need to be careful to give a link to the documents being hosted, instead of the link to a download page. Lots of download pages are pages that will download a file that is stored somewhere else on the internet. 

#### Installing the Version
First, you need to find the version of minecraft you want to install. You want to specifically find the server files that you are going to install, and then you install them using 'wget [link]' command mentioned above. 

#### Installing the Backbone
If you are not using mods, then you can skip this step. 



Then unzip the zip file.
