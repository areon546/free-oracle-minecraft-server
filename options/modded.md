# How to set up a Modded Server

The various server types have their own instructions.

First you need to download the actual server from their websites, and then optionally add any mods, modpacks, or plugins you want to add to the server.
You will likely have to unzip some resources after downloading them, and to do so you may have to download a package to unarchive them.
