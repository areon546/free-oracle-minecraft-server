# Docker Minecraft Installation (in progress)

What is docker?

Docker is a way to enforce the correct dependencies are installed, every single time you setup a server.
It saves a lot of time, however needs some setup.

The most important thing however, if you setup a docker file properly, you will be able to perform as much setup as you want upon a server automatically.
It can save a lot of time, however requires you to learn a fair bit.
Luckily, most of that learning is optional, only if you want to make your own. Instead you can use docker containers other people have made.
